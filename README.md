# TinyJpgPngCompress
Compress image files local on your computer with TinyJPG / TinyPNG.

<b><h3>What does TinyJPG do?</h3></b><br>
TinyJPG reduces the file size of your JPEG images. Every uploaded image is analyzed to apply the best possible JPEG encoding. Based on the content of your image an optimal strategy is chosen. The result is a quality image without wasting storage or bandwidth!

<b><h3>Why should I use TinyJPG?</h3></b><br>
JPEG is the most popular format for photos on your websites and apps. Many JPEG files do not use optimal compression, wasting valuable bytes. Balancing quality and small file size used to be a time consuming task that only humans could do. Not anymore. Let us worry about compression.

<b><h3>How does it work?</h3></b><br>
Excellent question! When you upload a JPEG file, the image is analyzed. Textures, patterns and colours are automatically identified. The encoder creates an optimally compressed JPEG file based on that information. The final result is compared with the orginal and fine-tuned. Distracting JPEG artifacts are minimized without big sacrifices in file size. Unnecessary metadata is stripped as well. You will get an optimal image, every time!

<em>Please make a backup of your images before you start, because the image files will be overwritten. I am not sure yet if i will build a automatically-backup feature in it.</em>
